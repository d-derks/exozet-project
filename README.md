# Exozet Challenge

This is a challenge from [Exozet](https://www.exozet.com/de/startpage/), made by Debbie Derks. For this project I've used the static site generator [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).



### CSS methodology
The CSS metrology used is inspired by SMACSS and BEM.

Every block component starts with b-component. When you go deeper into the component, the component starts with the component name, then added with ‘-‘ and a name. Like for example: component-inner. Variants start with is-variant.

### Criteria
- Component-based
- Cross-browser development
- Responsive for all devices
- Sticky footer
- Favicon
